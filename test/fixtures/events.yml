# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

# eventValidA:
#   event_name: 'Main Event'
#   event_description: 'Main Event Description'
#   event_time: <%= DateTime.now + 1.month %>
